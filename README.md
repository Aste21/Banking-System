# Banking-System
Program which simulates a customer bank account management system.


Task description

The aim of the exercise is to write a program that simulates a customer bank account management
system. The system should allow to carry out basic operations on your virtual bank accounts. The
system should allow to:
 create a new account with the following fields describing the customer:
– account number (generated by the program),
– name,
– surname,
– address,
– identification number (PESEL),
– current balance of regular account,
– current balance of savings sub-account,
 list all accounts present in the database,
 search for an account using one of the following fields: account number, name, surname, address,
identification number,
 make a deposit,
 make a withdrawal,
 make a money transfer between two accounts,
 make a money transfer to/from savings sub-account.
Guidelines
 All data should be read from and displayed on the terminal.
 The records must be read from the file and updated in the file, caching the records in memory
is not allowed. Update must take place after every modifying operation
 The program must accept unlimited number of accounts
 Always verify if a correct string of data was read from the terminal before you process the data.
 Limit numbers and strings to avoid overflow and memory errors (boundary errors).
 Check if current operation is allowed.
 Ask for confirmation before every modifying operation on the bank account. Asking for confir-
mation of every operation is not accepted.
 Do not use account identifiers longer than a few characters if typing them would be necessary
to perform operations
